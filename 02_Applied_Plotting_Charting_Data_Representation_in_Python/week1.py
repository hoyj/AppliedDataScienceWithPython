### Visualization Wheel (Alberto Cairo)

* Abstraction - Figuration
    - Boxes and charts (abstraction)
        vs
    - Real-world physical objects (figuration)

* Functionality - Decoration
    - No embellishments (functionality)
        vs
    - Artistic embellishments (decoration)

* Density - Lightness
    - Must be studied in depth (density)
        vs
    - Understandable at a glance (lightness)

* Multidimensional - Unidimensional
    - Different aspects of phenomena (multidimensional)
        vs
    - Single or few items of phenomena (unidimensional)

* Originality - Familiarity
    - Novel methods of visualization (originality)
        vs
    - Established and well understood methods of visualization (familiarity)

* Novelty - Redundancy
    - Explaining each item once (novelty)
        vs
    - Encoding multiple explanations of the same phenomena (redundancy)

### Graphical heuristics : Data-ink ratio (Edward Tufte)
* What is heuristics?
    : process or a rule that is meant to guide you in decision making.
    : not optimal or perfect but 'practical'

* Data-ink ratio
    : remove unnecessary 'ink' (information) => more simpler and readable
    : but increase the amount of information the viewer sees

* ex: Dark Horse Analytics

### Graphical heuristics : Chart junk (Edward Tufte)
* 3 kinds of chart junk
    1. Unintended optical art
        : patterns in graphs etc
        : rather just label them directly
    2. Grid
        : unnecessary
    3. duck
        : non-data creative graphics

### Graphical heuristics : Lie Factor and Spark Lines (Edward Tufte)
* Spark Lines
    : a small graph, say a time series graph
    : 'data words'
    : intriguing way to bridge the gap between text and figures

* Lie Factor
    : size of an effect shown in the graphic divided by,
      the size of the effect actually in the data

### The Truthful Art (Alberto Cairo)
* 5 part framework for considering the qualities of an information graphic
    1. truthful 
        - subjective. But, 
        - honest with ourselves that we are not obscuring data.
        - misleading audience
    2. functionality
    3. beauty
        - different perceptions on beauty
    4. insightful
        - draw the viewer in for 'a-ha eureka!' moment
    5. enlightening
        - different from insightful
        - combination of previous four, but adds a social responsibility
